## Self-Study Questions


1. If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

- Semantic HTML is giving every element on your webpage meaning. Before semantic html became a thing, we styled and wrapped all of our elements with a div tag -- which we still use but it's become best practice to use when styling now. Semantic HTML also helps with screen readers as well as allowing the website to rank higher in search engines (i.e. SEO) due to its readability by search engines.

2. Name two big differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

- display:block will take up the entire width of the parent container by default whereas an inline will take up only the spaces necessary.
- display:block will also start on a new line (see "entire width" above) as opposed to inline.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
- From the outermost wrapper to the innermost: margin - border - padding - content

4. While using flexbox, what axis does the following property work on: ```align-items: center```?
- y-axis

5. Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.
- git keeps a history of all phases of a project assuming that the developer has regularly commited their project. It also assists in allowing a team to work together on a single project, through assigning different features of the project to devs and merging all codes onto one branch. As mentioned in the beginning of this answer, it also keeps a history of all feature branches by all members of the team.
- since git allows us to keep our projects and codes on a remote server, it also keeps our own work station/system/computer/etc clutter free. It's a great tool to keep everything organized, pretty much.
